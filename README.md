# A Voyage into LLMs: From Inception to Mastery

Welcome to the SoC project 'A Voyage into LLMs: From Inception to Mastery'. Here we're going to delve deep into NLP and LLMs and cover all the aspects starting from the basics with no prerequisites involved. 

## About the project

The project will aim on covering LLMs and NLP from the basics while going into depth of each topic for better understanding. Throughout this project, mentees will dive into Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and PyTorch, while exploring deep learning concepts. 


- The project will tentatively be 8 weeks long. 
- There are no prerequisites. Basic knowledge of Python would be helpful.
- Each week mentees will be given resources to study and a small assignment to practice.
- 7-10 hours of weekly time commitment is expected from mentees._(However, this can vary from week to week)._
- Finishing assignments before deadline is mandatory for certification.

## Tentative Timeline

- Week 1: Pandas, NumPy and basics of Python
- Week 2: Text Processing and Embeddings 
- Week 3: Introduction to Neural Networks
- Week 4: RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
- Week 5: Attention Mechanism
- Week 6: Transformers + Hugging Face
- Week 7: Fine-tuning pretrained models + RAG Model + LangChain
- Week 8: Final Project
